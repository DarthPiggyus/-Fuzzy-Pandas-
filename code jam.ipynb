    "Title: Web Scraping IMDB for Movie and Actor Data\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, timely and relevant information is crucial. Data on websites like IMDB is often updated, and it's important to have systems that can periodically retrieve new or updated data. In this project, we will build a robust web scraping system to gather data from the IMDB website on movies and their star actors. This system will allow us to fetch and update our dataset at different points in time, ensuring that we always have the most current information.\n",
